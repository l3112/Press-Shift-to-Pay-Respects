# Press-Shift-to-Pay-Respects

All boxes checked between the first and last box you’ve checked, nice.

listen for checkbox activity 
(input type - checkbox)
eventlistener for a click (or keyboard ‘click’)
put the first check into a variable. (as let, it’s reassigned constantly)
see if shift key is down.
and if key is down and box is checked, have a blast, do what you want.

“Is the checkbox equal to the one being checked”?
